# Course Overview

The syllabus (available on blackboard) is the most authoritative and up-to-date place for information about the schedule and / or policies.  You are responsible for reviewing it on a regular basis!  The instructor will strive to notify you of any updates.

## Class Flow

* This is a \(mostly\) flipped class – you are expected to review Jupyter Notebooks and Readings for the week  _before _ class
* Class time will be devoted to answering your questions and working through exercises
  * Most work will be done in pairs
* Most classes will have a quick quiz at the beginning of class to check your understanding of that week’s materials
  * Quizzes will be drawn directly from readings and provided materials
  * Quizzes account for 20% of your grade

## Assignments (IST707)

* **10 assignments \(30 points total\)**
  * 2 warm\-up assignments \(1 point each\) : Covering background necessary for this class

# Introduction to ML

## What is Machine Learning?

* __Tom M\. Mitchell \(1997\)__ :
  * "A computer program is said to learn from experience  _E_  with respect to some class of tasks  _T_  and performance measure  _P_ \, if its performance at tasks in  _T_ \, as measured by  _P_ \, improves with experience  _E_ \."
  * Source:  _Machine Learning_ \, Tom M\. Mitchell\, McGraw Hill\, 1997\.
* __Arthur Samuel \(1959\)__ :
  * "Machine Learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\."
  * Arthur Samuel is credited with coining the term "Machine Learning" in 1959\. He's known for his work on the Samuel Checkers\-playing Program\.
* __Kevin P\. Murphy \(2012\)__ :
  * "Machine learning is a set of methods that can automatically detect patterns in data\, and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data\, or to perform other kinds of decision\-making under uncertainty \(such as planning how to collect more data\)\."
  * Source:  _Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective_ \, Kevin P\. Murphy\, MIT Press\, 2012\.
* __Aurélien Géron \(2015\)__ :
  * "Machine Learning is the science \(and art\) of programming computers so they can learn from data\.”
  * Source: Hands\-on Machine Learning \(your text\-book\!\)

## ML Origins

* __Early Theoretical Foundations__ :
  * “Reason\.\.\. is nothing but Reckoning \(that is\, Adding and Subtracting\) of the Consequences of general names agreed upon for the marking and signifying of our thoughts\.\.\.” –  _Thomas Hobbs\, Leviathon \(1651\)_
* __Turing Test \(1950\)__ :
  * A "universal machine" that could simulate the behavior of any other machine
  * The "Turing Test" as a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human\.
* __Advent of Electronic Computers \(1940s\-1950s\)__ :
  * The creation of electronic computers provided the necessary tools for exploring computational approaches to problem\-solving\.
* __Birth of Artificial Intelligence \(1956\)__ :
  * At the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956\, the term "Artificial Intelligence" \(AI\) was coined\. This event is often considered the birth of AI as a formal academic discipline\. Early AI research focused on problem\-solving\, logical reasoning\, and symbolic methods\.

# Applications of Machine Learning

* __Healthcare & Life Sciences__
  * Disease Identification & Diagnostics\,  Drug Discovery & Personalized Medicine\, Predictive Analytics
* __Finance & Banking__
  * Fraud Detection\,  Algorithmic Trading\,  Credit Scoring
* __E\-Commerce & Retail__
  * Recommendation Systems\, Demand Forecasting\, Customer Sentiment Analysis
* __Automotive & Transportation__
  * Autonomous Vehicles\,  Predictive Maintenance\, Traffic Prediction
* __Energy & Utilities__
  * Smart Grid Management\, Predictive Maintenance for Equipment\, Energy Consumption Forecasting
* __Entertainment & Media__
  * Content Recommendation\, Sentiment Analysis\, Automated Content Creation

# ACTIVITY: Brainstorming applications (10 min)

# The Importance of Communication

* __Translating Technicalities__ :
  * ML involves intricate algorithms\, complex mathematical models\, and vast amounts of data\.
  * Stakeholders are often more interested in the  _actionable insights\._
  * ML practitioners must articulate findings in a comprehensible and meaningful manner\.
* __Understanding Stakeholder Needs__
  * Essential to understand the problem from a stakeholder's perspective\. Aims? Constraints?
  * Solutions must meet the needs of those who will use or be affected by the model\.
* __Setting Clear Expectations__ :
  * Overhype leads to disappointment and mistrust\.
  * Misuse can cause substantive harm
  * Vital to communicate what a model can and cannot do\, its limitations\, and any uncertainties involved\.
* __Ethical Considerations__ :
  * Increasing concerns about ML’s ethical implications\, potential biases\, and fairness\.
  * Transparent communication about how models work and their potential pitfalls is crucial\.

# Failures of Communication

* __Google Flu Trends__  <span style="color:#D1D5DB">: </span>
  * Google’s attempt to predict flu outbreaks using search query data\.
  * High expectations and inconsistent performance led to skepticism about the utility of big data
  * Effort terminated\.
* __IBM Watson for Oncology__  <span style="color:#D1D5DB">:</span>
  * Promised to revolutionize cancer treatment by providing personalized treatment recommendations
  * Erroneous treatment recommendations & over\-promotion of Watson's capabilities without clear communication about its limitations
  * Effort terminated

# The Case of COMPAS

* __COMPAS \(Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions\)__
  * Risk assessment tool used by the U\.S\. courts to assess the likelihood of recidivism
* __Fairness and Goal alignment__
  * ProPublica Analysis \(2016\): Black defendants had high false positive rate\, white defendants had high false negative rate
  * Northpointe Rebuttal: “Predictive parity\.” Risk levels equivalent across groups
* __Misuse__
  * Designed to aid in decisions about pretrial release\, parole\, and probation
  * But documented cases of being used for sentencing guidelines
* __Transparency Issues__
  * proprietary tool; inner workings are not open to public scrutiny
  * ethical questions about the use of "black\-box" models in consequential decisions
